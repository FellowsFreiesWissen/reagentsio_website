Dear science facilitator,

Recently, I have designed and launched a new Open Source project linked to lab material. The ultimate goal is to make all scientific reagents easily and persistently identifiable, and described in a computer-readable way in the published research literature. I am reaching out to you to request your assistance and support in helping to push and develop the project. The eLIFE inovation sprint (during the Mozilla Sciene Sprint, 10-11 May) will see the real start of the project, and I would be happy to see you participate in the project.

I would like to build an open community to:

- Develop standards to describe all reagents in the literature and in the lab (one standard per reagent, one standard to pool them all into one spreadsheet format).
- Develop tools to help scientists implement these standards in their lab inventory, as well as "import upon purchase"" and "export upon publication" functionalities.
- Develop communication strategies or business models to make it successful and sustainable for research communities.

As you might have realised, the project wants to build for materials what protocols.io did so well for methods, and we got the chance to get the www.reagents.io domain for its web vitrine. The home of this project is a GitHub repository, currently available here: https://github.com/jcolomb/reagentsio_website.

Please enroll and/or write us any feedback here: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/reagents.io.

Please help us by sharing the project with anyone you think might be interested, every input will be highly valued and appreciated!

Best,

Julien Colomb
