Dear science facilitator,

During the last week, I have been starting an open source project linked to lab material. The ultimate goal is to make all scientific reagents easily identifiable and described in a computer readable way  in the literature. I was hoping YOU could help pushing and developing the project. The elife inovation sprint (during the mozilla sprint, 10-11 mai) will see the real start of the project, and I would be happy to see you participate in the project.

I would like to build an open community to 

- develop standards to describe all reagents in the literature and in the lab (one standard per reagent, one standard to pool them all into one spreadsheet format).
- develop tools to help scientists implement these standards in their lab inventory, as well as "import upon purchase"" and "export upon publication" functionalities.
- develop communication strategies or business model to make it successful and sustainable.

As you might have realised, the project wants to build for material what protocols.io did for methods, and we got the chance to get the www.reagents.io domain for its web vitrine. The home of this project is a github repository available here for now: https://github.com/jcolomb/reagentsio_website

Please enroll and/or write us any feedback here: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/reagents.io

Best regards,
Julien Colomb
