## Me 30s:
My name is Julien Colomb, I am swiss, live in Berlin, Germany with my wife and my 2 kids. I am a former researcher on fruit fly behavior and neuro-genetics, as it is called. I am an open science advocate and a self-taught R coder. I am also the founder of drososhare.net, a peer2peer version of addgene for fruit flies (, or a want-to-be one). 

I am also involved in the open science MOOC of Jon Tennants, have created workshop to teach open science skills, co-organiser of open science meetups in Berlin. Monday, I start a new job to create videos for the promotion of open science and open data.


## project 60s:

---

During the next 2 days, I want to work on answering the question: "how to report material in the literature"
The situation today is quite absurd:

- reagent providers have clean, computer readable data.
- but the literature has some text reporting corrupted and unsufficent information

In the middle we have scientist (who do not really care), and on the right, we have literature curator, trying to create computer readable data form that ***** text

This project is about helping the scientists: it is about creating standards on what to report, how to report it and how to tranfert information from providers to publishers. 
So the core of the project is to create open standards, but coders are also welcome!

The big greedy Elsevier has started to build its own solution (called the "STAR table"), reagents.io needs to beat them by being better, faster and open source.

Who's in ?

Especially interested in non-coders to create the standards, coders to facilitate the use of the standards and communicators who can transform this idea into reality.
