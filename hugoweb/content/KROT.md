Create a format to report material in one unique, small spreadsheet.  
Actually 2 versions will be built: one with all the information to be published independently of the paper, and one with the most important ones to be integrated in the paper itself as a table (i.e. it needs to be relatively compact).


It should be flexible for different reagents, have a maximum of 5 columns, easy to write by humanms, readable by machines, exhaustive, be useful for the scientists. Inspiration comes from the : [ART project](https://wiki.flybase.org/wiki/FlyBase:Author_Reagent_Table_(ART)){target="_blank"}. In the column, in order to pool different information into one column, we will use a synthax of the type:

    ` origingal_spreadsheet_header:"*information*"; `

Each reagent will indeed have its spreadsheet with unlimited number of columns. Each columns will be assigned a column in each KROT versions. A small application will transform formats into one other.
